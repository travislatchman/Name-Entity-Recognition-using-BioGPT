Named Entity Recognition to Find Adverse Drug Reaction Entities with BioGPT

**Brief Description:** The project involved fine-tuning the BioGPT model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical texts, particularly for identifying adverse drug reactions.

### Implementation (see notebook for each task):
* Introduction to Hugging Face NLP modeling.
* Performed Token Classification, a specific type of NLP task.
* Utilized a drug label dataset for Named Entity Recognition.
* Fine-tuned a biomedical GPT model (BioGPT) for our specific task.
